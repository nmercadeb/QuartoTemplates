abstract="Allergenicity depends on several factors determined by the very physicochemical nature of the molecules themselves, i.e., their capacity to penetrate the horny layer, lipophilicity, and chemical reactivity. The sensitizing property of the majority of contact allergens could be predicted from these characteristics (Patlewicz et al., Contact Dermatitis 50:91--97, 2004; Gerberick et al., Altern Lab Anim 36(2):215--242, 2008). Two other factors, however, further contribute to the allergenicity of chemicals, namely, their pro-inflammatory activity and capacity to induce maturation of LC. These issues will be dealt with in more detail in the following sections.",
